## Relational Plots
Relational plots are used to understand the relationships between two or more variables in your data.

- **scatterplot**: Scatter plots to represent pairwise relationships.
- **lineplot**: Line plots for visualizing trends in data.

## Categorical Plots
Categorical plots are used for visualizing data that can be categorized based on some qualitative properties.

- **catplot**: A versatile interface for drawing categorical plots.
- **boxplot**: Display the distribution of a categorical variable using boxes and whiskers.
- **violinplot**: Combines aspects of boxplots and KDE plots for categorical data.
- **stripplot**: A scatter plot for categorical variables.
- **swarmplot**: A categorical scatter plot with non-overlapping points.
- **barplot**: Bar charts to represent an estimate of central tendency for a numeric variable.
- **countplot**: Histograms for categorical variables.

## Distribution Plots
Distribution plots are designed to show the distribution of a dataset and to visualize it in various ways.

- **histplot**: Histograms and binnings for visualizing distributions.
- **kdeplot**: Kernel Density Estimation plots.
- **ecdfplot**: Empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions.
- **jointplot**: Combines multiple plots for bivariate analysis.
- **pairplot**: Plot pairwise relationships in a dataset.

## Regression Plots
Regression plots are utilized for observing the relationship between dependent and independent variables and fitting a regression model to the data.

- **regplot**: Scatter plots with linear regression fits.
- **lmplot**: Combines regplot and FacetGrid.

## Matrix Plots
Matrix plots allow you to plot data as color-encoded matrices and can also be used to indicate clusters within the data.

- **heatmap**: Represent data as a colored matrix.
- **clustermap**: Clustered heatmap with hierarchical clustering.
